        <h2 class="highlightedHeading">Software Audit</h2>
        <p class="details">
          This service is mainly dedicated to companies who already have
          established development processes, but it seems to be inefficient or
          slow. The audit embraces the whole software development life cycle
          from its beginning till the end. We take into account every aspect,
          not only on the code level. Our goal is to identify delivery and
          maintainability bottlenecks. During delivery level, we try to
          understand what steps are taken from idea generation until getting the
          feature deployed to production. Maintainability level involves
          analysing architecture as well as quality of the code, its readability
          and modularity. As the outcome of the audit, we preparea document
          containing all found issues, possible approaches to solvethe problems
          and suggestions on process improvements.<br />
          If you want to learn more, here is a detailed plan of how we conduct
          an audit:
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">
          Introduction meeting during which we establish the scope of an audit
        </h3>
        <p class="details">
          The purpose of this meeting is to determine your needs and specify our
          work scope.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Domain knowledge crunching</h3>
        <ul class="details">
          <li>
            We use event storming + event modelling to understand the process
            and how the domain works.
          </li>
          <li>Discussion with the tech team.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Documentation review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          Before diving into the code we need to understand the reasoning behind
          the project technical decisions. We evaluate how the documentation
          diverges from the code. We assess its usefulness and whether it is not
          misleading.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Code structure review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          We analyse the query path and use cases along with the model. We
          investigate whether the code is divided into coherent pieces called
          feature slices.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Architecture review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          Armed with domain knowledge and reasoning behind project decisions
          gained thanks to team discussions and getting familiar with the
          documentation, we are able to learn more about project architecture.
          At this stage, we focus on reviewing communication patterns between
          internal and external services.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Production code quality review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          Now we get to the heart of the project. There is an industry saying
          “code doesn’t lie, everything else can”. During the code review, we
          concentrate on the methods/functions naming, names of variables, size
          of functions, model fitting.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Test code quality review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          We treat tests as production code. We review the quality of the code,
          proportions of different types of tests, dependencies between test
          code, use case coverage, and code coverage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Infrastructure review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          We verify how implementation is done in terms of infrastructure. We
          check the process of security updates, the process of updating
          libraries, and we analyse metrics.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Development process review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          What are the steps from idea generation till deploying to production?
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">CI/CD pipeline review</h3>
        <p class="details">
          Continuous integration is coupled with the development process so to
          achieve quicker delivery we should first improve the development
          process. We analyze the release cycle, CI/CD pipeline and automation
          of the process.

          That service is mostly directed to early stage startups. We will
          validate your ideas on both technical and business levels.<br />
          We are going to ask all those uncomfortable questions that arise from
          our understanding of the business you want to run.<br />We will try to
          help you to prepare the development plan and point out all areas the
          team should particularly think through. The outcome will be documented
          with all architectural recommendations.

          We want to understand where you are with your product and where you
          want to be. Together, we are going to list all aspects of the product
          we would like to focus on.

          Event storming meeting and Event modeling process level
        </h3>
        <p class="details">
          That stage has a form of a workshop. We are willing to understand what
          your business is about and we use Event Storming (depending on the
          product we may also use Domain Storytelling) to achieve that. After
          the workshop we should be aware of the problem you would like to solve
          and how you want to solve it.

        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">
          Discuss product road map or create one (optional)

        <p class="details">
          There is a saying in the time management domain, “How do you eat an
          elephant?” and the answer is “Piece by piece”, and that is how we are
          going to help you prepare a road map for your product.

          First we are going to establish what kind of people you need and then
          provide you with a dedicated team to develop your product. A deliver a
          fully operable team of developers to coin your product plan to the
          actual software. We believe in tight cooperation with the business and
          a secret ingredient in a form of a deep understanding of requirements.
          That is why we follow Domain Driven-Design practice, strategic and
          tactic design.<br />Quick agile development cycle provides quick
          feedback to business which allows us to correct our tracks.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Briefing/Planning meeting</h3>
        <p class="details">
          The objective of the meeting is to get to know each other better, as
          well as briefly understand what kind of product you would like to
          build. We are eager to learn how your product roadmap looks like, and
          how it is reflected in your backlog. Based on that input, together we
          are going to estimate your development needs. After that, we set the
          team on our side up and start iterative delivery of your great
          product.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Iteration process:</h3>
        <ul class="details">
          <li>
            Domain exploration on feature according to the road map<br />
            Dev people need to understand what business problem they will try to
            solve in the upcoming iteration and what kind of business solution
            they need to implement. That is a highly collaborative meeting
            during which we look at the feature from different angles to catch
            all the corner cases and inconsistencies. After the meeting
            developers should be armed with domain knowledge which helps them in
            feature implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Defining the scope of the iteration<br />
            Developers give a raw estimate and discuss with PO what tasks are
            included in the iteration. At this meeting any doubts about the
            tasks should be verified and tackled. As a result, the list of tasks
            ordered by their priority is prepared.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Development</h3>
        <p class="details">
          Let’s begin the boring development stuff :) We develop what was
          established according to task acceptance criteria. The result of our
          work is a functioning feature in the pre-production environment. We
          use continuous delivery as our tool for quick releases, and business
          can decide what is deployed to production. Every potencial commit is
          ready to be deployed on production.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Demo</h3>
        <p class="details">
          At the end of iteration we show what was done by presenting new
          application features. You will have a chance to play with the new
          functionalities and give us your feedback.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Retrospective/Feedback</h3>
        <p class="details">
          We need to make sure we are on the right track whether everything is
          working as intended and meets expectations. The objective of this
          meeting is to ask inconvenient/unpleasant questions, prepare ideas on
          how we can improve, and create a correction plan if necessary.

          our best developers who will be available for you on a video call
          (onsite is also possible just after the pandemic) for the time we
          agreed upon. Sometimes it happens that to give proper answers and some
          improvement advice we need to prepare offline. In that case, we have
          to settle the time limit. Providing us with a list of
          questions/problems before the meeting is most desirable.
        </p>
        <h3 class="highlightedSubheading">Briefing meeting</h3>
        <p class="details">
          We go through every problem/question from the list and discuss it.
          Some of them will probably need more explanation, some of them we will
          be able to answer straight away, and some of them will be noted down
          so we could prepare a comprehensive answer. Some of the problems might
          be more complex and will require from us a moment to think or even
          have a brainstorming session. In this situation we come back to you as
          soon as we are ready to elaborate on these issues.<br />
          Document with all unanswered questions from first meeting We prepare
          answers for all questions/problems on paper.<br />
          If it is required, we can present our answers in a meeting, during
          which you could ask additional questions much quicker.

          If you have established your development machine but it seems like

          You will get just a small extension of your current team which will
          follow all your practices and processes. We believe a small extension
          (1-2+ devs) is working best in nearshore setup. In offshore setup, on
          the other hand, the extension needs to be a little bit bigger meaning
          2-5 devs. The team is self-organizing but still follows your
          development practices. All developers report directly to you or people
          in your company.

          Introduce developers to the rest of the client team
        </h3>
        <p class="details">
          At that meeting the whole team is present to have the opportunity to
          get to know each other better. It would be good to establish a host
          developer for each of our devs to do a smooth introduction to the
          project. One of our recommendations to make the onboarding process
          effective is to do pair programming (client dev and our dev) during
          1-2 first iterations.
